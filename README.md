### 📍 You are here

Supposedly, at least. Welcome!

I graduated last year in computer science and linguistics, and I'm OCI-certified with experience in AWS and Azure and 6+ years of working with full-stack web development. That includes extensive work in frontend frameworks like React and Vue. If you're here to hear about that, you'll want these three links:

- 💼 **LinkedIn**: https://linkedin.com/in/hat
- 📝 **Portfolio** (currently **unmaintained**): https://hadi.is/stuff
- 🎱 **8-ball to convince you to hire me**: https://magic-8ball.com/

As for this page, my main interest right now is making languages **fun** to document and explore digitally. My current outlet for that dream is my ["dialect museum"](https://github.com/supposedly/dialect-museum) or dialect-atlas project. My past body of work includes [cellular automata](https://github.com/supposedly/nutshell) and occasional [weekend games](https://github.com/supposedly/mine-tac-toe). Thank you for visiting!
